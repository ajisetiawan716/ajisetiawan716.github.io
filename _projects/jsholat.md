Jsholat (luci-app-jsholat ) is an OpenWRT-based application that displays prayer times and delivers adhan (Islamic call to prayer) notifications via audio. Using the `madplay` program, it plays adhan MP3 files through a USB speaker connected to a soundcard. Jsholat runs automatically at each prayer time to broadcast the adhan.
